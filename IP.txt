Internet Protocol (IP) is like a set of rules that devices follow to communicate over a network. 
It decides how data is sent, addressed, and delivered from one device to another.

IP adress is just the part of the system

TYPES OF IP Addressing:
    1. Based on Addressing Scheme: IPv4 vs IPv6
        IPv4:
            Length:32 bits
            Allows 4.3 billion unique addresses
            4 octets
            octet 1-3 indicates the network,rest (last) indicates the host which is useful or router to get to know "in which network i have to 
            send data and to which device"
        IPv6:
            Length:128 bits
            allows way more unique addresses than IPv4
            8 grps of hexadecimal degits separated by colons
    2. Based on usage: Private and public
        Public IP address:  
            Unique globally, assigned by ISP's (Internet service providers)
            Accessible from anywhere on the internet unless blocked by firewalls
            Can be static (permanent) or dynamic (changes over time)
            used for servers, websites or any other device needing internet access.
        Private IP address:
            Used in private networks (home, office); not routable on the internet
            Must be unique only within the local network
    3. Based on assignment:
        Static IP: Permanently assigned; used for servers or devices requiring consistent address.
        Dynamic IP: Temporarily assigned by DHCP; common for consumer devices
    
Suppose you want to send data (like an email) from Kolkata to New York. First, your device in Kolkata gets a private IP address from your 
router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). This private IP allows your device to communicate within your local network, 
but it cannot travel across the internet. To send data outside the network, the router uses NAT (Network Address Translation),
 which maps your private IP to the public IP of your network.
Once your data has a public IP, it is broken into packets, each containing a header with the source IP (your public IP) and the destination 
IP (New York server). These packets are routed through multiple intermediate routers, which read the destination IP and forward each packet 
along the optimal path to the server in New York.
When the server receives all the packets, it reassembles them into the original data and sends an acknowledgement back to your public IP. 
When the acknowledgement reaches your router in Kolkata, NAT converts the public IP back to your private IP, so your device can receive it. 
This is how communication using IP addresses, DHCP, NAT, and routers works across networks.
