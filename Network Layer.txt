NETWORK LAYER
    The Network Layer is responsible for source-to-destination delivery of data across multiple networks. 
    Unlike the Data Link Layer (which only handles hop-to-hop delivery between directly connected devices), 
    the Network Layer ensures that the packet travels through intermediate routers until it reaches the correct destination device.

FUNCTIONS OF THE NETWORK LAYER
    1. Logical Addressing (IP Addressing):
        Every device gets a unique IP address at this layer.
        Unlike MAC (Data Link Layer) addresses that are local and physical, IP addresses allow identification of devices across 
        different networks.
    2. Routing
        The layer determines the best path for the packet to travel.
        Routing algorithms and protocols (like RIP, OSPF, BGP) help routers build routing tables.
        Ensures efficient delivery even if multiple paths exist.
    3. Forwarding
        Once the best path is chosen, the packet is forwarded to the correct output interface of the router.
        This is the actual act of moving the packet closer to its destination.
    4. Packetizing (Encapsulation)
        The Network Layer encapsulates the segment (from Transport Layer) into a packet (often called a datagram in IP context).
        Adds headers containing source IP, destination IP, and other info.
    5. Fragmentation and Reassembly
        If a packet is too large for a networkâ€™s MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), it is fragmented into smaller packets.
        At the destination, the fragments are reassembled to reconstruct the original data.
    6. Host-to-Host Delivery
        Ensures that data actually reaches the correct end device, not just the next router.
    7. Subnetting & NAT
        Subnetting: Divides large networks into smaller manageable networks.
        NAT: Converts private IPs into a public IP to allow Internet communication.
