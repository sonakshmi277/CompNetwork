Transmission media:
    Transmission media refers to the general concept of how data is transported between sender and receiver.
    A transmission medium is the actual physical path or channel used to transmit the data.
    
Transmission medium is subdivided into:
    1. Guided Media :
            Data signals are guided along a physical path.
            Types:
                1.1. TWISTED PAIR CABLE:
                    Generally contains collection of two copper wires twisted around each other.
                        Further divided into: 
                            SHIELDED TWISTED PAIR:
                                Consists of twisted pair cables enclosed in an external shield 
                                (foil or braided copper) to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) 
                                and crosstalk. It provides better performance at higher data rates and 
                                is commonly used in environments where the possibility of noise is very 
                                high, such as industrial areas or near heavy electrical equipment.

                            UNSHIELDED TWISTED PAIR:
                                Contains collection of twisted pair cable with no external shield.
                                Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP), on the other hand, consists of twisted pair 
                                cables without any external shielding. It relies solely on the twisting of 
                                wires to minimize interference. UTP is cheaper, lighter, and easier to 
                                install than STP.

    2. Unguided Media :
        Data signals are transmitted through air, water and vaccum without any physical conductor.
