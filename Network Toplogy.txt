NETWORK TOPOLOGY (DEFI):
    Network topology is the arrangement of devices (nodes) and connections (links) in a computer network.
    It shows how computers, servers, and other devices are connected and how data flows between them. 
    There are two main types of topology:
        Physical Topology: The actual physical layout of cables and devices.
        Logical Topology: How data moves across the network, regardless of the physical layout.
    Choosing the right topology is very important because it directly affects the performance, cost, reliability, scalability, and security of 
    the network.

    POINT-TO-POINT TOPOLOGY:
        Point-to-Point topology is the simplest form of network topology.
        It establishes a direct connection between two nodes, where one acts as the sender and the other as the receiver. 
        This setup provides high bandwidth and reliable communication between the two nodes. 
        However, it is limited to only two devices.
    MESH TOPOLOGY:
        In a mesh topology, every device is connected to every other device through dedicated links. These links are known as channels.
        If there are N devices, then each device requires N–1 ports to connect with others.
        The total number of dedicated links required is N × (N–1)/2.
        Advantages:
            Provides very fast and reliable communication.
            Highly robust and fault-tolerant, since multiple paths exist.
            Security and privacy are high because data travels via dedicated channels.
            Easy to diagnose faults.
        Disadvantages:
            Installation and configuration are complex.
            Requires a large amount of cabling, so cost is very high.
            Maintenance is also expensive.
        Example: Internet backbone, military communication systems, and aircraft navigation networks.
    STAR TOPOLOGY:
        In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. 
        The hub can be:
            Passive: Simply forwards signals (like broadcasting).
            Active: Contains repeaters and can regenerate signals.
        Advantages:
            Easy to set up and expand.
            Requires only one port per device.
            Robust: If one link fails, only that device is affected.
            Fault isolation is simple.
            Cost-effective since inexpensive cables like coaxial or RJ-45 are used.
        Disadvantages:
            The central hub is a single point of failure; if it fails, the whole network collapses. 
            Installation cost is higher compared to bus.
            Performance depends heavily on the hub.
        Example: Local Area Networks (LANs) in offices and wireless networks with a central access point.
    BUS TOPOLOGY:
        In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single backbone cable. Data is transmitted in both directions.
        Advantages:
            Requires only one main cable (backbone), plus drop lines for each device.
            Cost of cabling is low compared to mesh and star.
            Well-known technology with easy installation.
        Disadvantages:
            If the backbone fails, the entire network fails.
            Performance decreases as network traffic increases due to collisions.
            Adding new devices slows down the network.
            Low security.
        Example: Early Ethernet networks, and cable TV networks.
    RING TOPOLOGY:
        In a ring topology, each device is connected to exactly two neighboring devices, forming a circular path. 
        Data travels in one direction (unidirectional) unless a dual ring is used.
        A token passing protocol is often used, where a special frame called a token circulates around the ring. 
        A device can only transmit data if it holds the token.
    TREE TOPOLOGY:
        Tree topology is a variation of star topology, where multiple star networks are arranged in a hierarchical manner.
        A central hub connects to secondary hubs, which in turn connect to devices.
        Data flows either top-to-bottom (from central hub down to devices) or bottom-to-top.
        Example: Organizational hierarchy in companies, where the CEO is the root, department heads are intermediate hubs, and employees are leaf nodes.
    HYBRID TOPOLOGY:
        Hybrid topology combines two or more different topologies, depending on requirements. 
        For example, a star-bus hybrid or star-ring hybrid.
        Example: University campus networks, where the backbone may use star topology, while individual buildings may use bus or ring internally.
