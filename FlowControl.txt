WHAT IS FLOW CONTROL
    Flow control is about matching the speed of sender and receiver.
    If the sender is very fast and the receiver is slow (or has a small buffer), then without flow control → buffer overflow + data loss.
    DLL ensures the receiver doesn’t get overwhelmed.

    Think of it like water in a pipe: if you pour too fast, the bucket overflows. Flow control = regulating flow to avoid overflow.

APPROACHES TO FLOW CONTROL
    1. Feedback-based flow control
        Receiver sends an ACK (acknowledgment) after processing a frame.
        Sender waits before sending the next one.
        Ensures synchronization, but throughput is limited by round-trip ACK delay.
    2. Rate-based flow control
        No explicit ACKs.
        Sender adjusts its rate automatically (based on protocol rules).
        Used where feedback is costly/unavailable (e.g., high-latency satellite links).

TECHNIQUES OF FLOW CONTROL
    1. Stop-and-Wait Flow Control
        Sender → sends 1 frame, then waits for ACK.
        After ACK, next frame is sent.
        Process repeats until transmission ends.

        Properties:
            Simple, reliable.
            Very inefficient for long-distance or high-speed networks (lots of waiting).
    2.  Sliding Window Flow Control
        Both sender and receiver maintain a window size (N).
        Sender can send up to N frames without waiting for ACKs.
        Receiver acknowledges as it processes.
        When ACK is received, the window “slides forward”, allowing new frames to be sent.

        Properties:
            Efficient, high throughput, better channel utilization.
            More complex to implement (requires sequence numbers, buffers).

NOTE: RELATION WITH ERROR CONTROL
    Stop-and-Wait ARQ and Sliding Window ARQ (Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat) are not just error control, but also flow control techniques.
    That's why flow control + error control often go hand in hand in DLL protocols.
