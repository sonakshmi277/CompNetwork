1. What is physical layer?
    The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. 
    It is responsible for the actual transmission of raw data bits (0s and 1s) over the communication medium.
    It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural characteristics of data transmission:
        Electrical → Specifies how data bits are represented as signals (e.g., voltage levels, light pulses, 
        radio waves).
        Mechanical → Defines the physical medium for transmission.
        Procedural → Defines the rules for establishing, maintaining, and terminating the physical connection 
        between the sender and receiver over the transmission medium.
    In short, the physical layer ensures that the bits from one device can be transmitted and correctly 
    received by another device through the chosen medium.
